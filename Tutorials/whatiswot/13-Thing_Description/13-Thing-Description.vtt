Previously, we introduced Thing and Thing Description. In this video, we will explain Thing Description with code snippets.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:16.437 
First, let’s do a recap on Thing and Thing Description.

00:00:16.437 --> 00:00:22.313 
In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:28.190 
IoT device or service. And TD provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.784 
As we explained in the previous building block video, TD is

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:37.377 
the core building block in the W3C Web of Things.

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:42.776 
A TD instance consists of 5 main components:

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.663 
Textual Metadata about Thing itself.

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:52.251 
Interaction Affordances (Properties, Actions, and Events) that indicate how the Thing can be used

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:57.713 
Schemas for the data exchanged with the thing for machine understandability,

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:05.048 
Security Definitions to provide metadata about the security mechanisms that must be used for interactions,

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:11.123 
Web links to express any formal or informal relation to other Things or documents on the Web.

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:16.773 
Let’s examine these components on a coffee machine TD code.

00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:24.585 
Here is the simplified version of the code. Let us explain what each keyword means in a TD.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:31.023 
with the “@context” keyword we can define the context of the TD document. It is

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:37.460 
a mandatory keyword, and It contains the vocabulary needed to fully interpret a TD document.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.635 
The “title” keyword is the human-readable descriptive title of the TD. It is also mandatory.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:52.360 
The “id” keyword provides a unique ID to a Thing Description, and it is optional.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.541 
“securityDefinitions” define the security mechanisms present in the Thing and security allows to express

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:04.723 
which ones are picked. We will go into more detail in the upcoming videos.

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:12.643 
And these are the interaction affordances. They consist of a set of capabilities and functionality exposed by a Thing

00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:20.564 
that can be controlled and interacted with by a Consumer. We can list them as properties, actions, and events.

00:02:20.564 --> 00:02:27.614 
We will explain these affordances in detail in the next video but now let's look at their functionality.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:32.305 
The sensing and control parameters of the Thing are represented with the properties keyword

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:36.997 
in a TD. Such as the state of the coffee machine, how much water

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:41.689 
or beans are left in the machine or how full is the bin.

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:48.406 
Actions are used to interact with a Thing. It consists of actions that can be invoked by

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:55.123 
the Consumer. For instance, in “BrewCoffee” brew the coffee of your choice and it can also take

00:02:55.123 --> 00:03:01.840 
input parameters like coffee type and sugar amount. “StopBrew” stopping brewing or “TurnOff” turns off the machine.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.336 
Events are used to be notified about specific events. Consumers can subscribe to those events. For our

00:03:09.336 --> 00:03:16.831 
coffee machine example, we can have water warning events to be notified when the water level is

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:24.327 
too low. Error Notification Event to be notified when the state of the machine is “error”.

00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:29.577
