00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.868 
In this video, we will give a introduction to the W3C Web of Things including its

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:13.737 
application domains and we will continue with architecture patterns, and building blocks in the upcoming videos.

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:17.012 
So let's start with what is WoT.

00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:23.912 
It is a set of standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:30.812 
(W3C) for the interoperability of different Internet of Things platforms and application domains.

00:00:30.812 --> 00:00:37.862 
The WoT aims to preserve and complement existing IoT standards and solutions by providing a

00:00:37.862 --> 00:00:44.912 
standardized approach for connecting and integrating smart devices, services, and applications into the Web.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:56.262 
Now, let us introduce some of the WoT application domains: Smart Homes, Industrial Applications, Agriculture, and Smart Cities.

00:00:56.262 --> 00:01:04.612 
In spaces like smart homes, it is very beneficial that multiple assets can be connected and managed over the network.

00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:11.200 
Depending on the conditions at home, various activities can be performed in the house or remotely.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.683 
For example, turning on lights, changing room temperature, turning home appliances

00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:24.167 
on and off, managing sound and security with a smartphone.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:30.819 
Thus, energy and other resources consumption can be optimized.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.019 
Let’s look at our smart home example closer.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:38.457 
You can have direct remote access through gateway and routers,

00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:43.819 
Or interactions happen through an intermediary like a cloud application.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.151 
Services running in the cloud collect data from edge devices and provide the data

00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:54.482 
to users of the smart home through edge devices such as phones or PCs.

00:01:54.482 --> 00:02:03.760 
Multiple edge devices are connected to the gateways through local communication protocols such as KNX, ECHONET, ZigBee.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.898 
Multiple gateways can exist in one home, whilst each gateway can support multiple local protocols.

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:18.735 
The next one is the Industrial applications of WoT.

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:23.685 
Let’s zoom in on this factory!

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:32.694 
Industrial applications may resemble smart home applications, but have different set of requirements. For instance, advanced monitoring of

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:41.704 
the connected manufacturing equipment as well as the manufactured products and predictions of any possible machine failures.

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:50.188 
Let's look at one smart factory example in detail. This time, different factory equipment is automated based

00:02:50.188 --> 00:02:58.672 
on industrial protocols such as PROFINET, Modbus, OPC UA. Since industrial environments like factories, have more strict

00:02:58.672 --> 00:03:07.157 
requirements, there are multiple controllers that are connected to the manufacturing equipment. An industrial edge device collects

00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:15.641 
data from various controllers and enables remote monitoring via a dashboard or analyzes it for preventive maintenance.

00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.391 
Another domain-specific application is in agriculture systems.

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:29.116 
With WoT, soil conditions can be monitored and optimal plans for watering and fertilizing can be created. Depending on

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:37.841 
the need, agricultural devices can be controled remotely. Thus the quality and quantity of the harvest can be increased.

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:42.629 
The last application domain we will explain is Smart Cities.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:52.258 
Similar to smart homes, monitoring of smart cities is possible. In this case, end users are citizens, municipalities, and government

00:03:52.258 --> 00:04:01.888 
agencies. In smart cities, bridges, dams, and canals can be monitored for material conditions or deterioration for maintenance repair work.

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:12.168 
Thus, significant damage is prevented. Parking slots and street lights can be monitored for crowd management and optimized usage too.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:18.075 
There are many more domain-specific examples in the WoT Architecture document besides the ones that we

00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:23.981 
listed in this video. If you want to learn more, you can check the website.
