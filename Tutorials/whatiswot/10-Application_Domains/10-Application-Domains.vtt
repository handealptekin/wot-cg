00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.925 
In this video, we will give a introduction to the W3C Web of Things including its

00:00:06.925 --> 00:00:13.850 
application domains and we will continue with architecture patterns, and building blocks in the upcoming videos.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.125 
So let's start with what is WoT.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:24.200 
It is a set of standards defined for the interoperability of different Internet

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.275 
of Things platforms and application domains by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:38.325 
The WoT aims to preserve and complement existing IoT standards and solutions by providing a

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:45.375 
standardized approach for connecting and integrating smart devices, services, and applications into the Web.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:56.725 
Now, let us introduce some of the WoT application domains: Smart Homes, Industrial Applications, Agriculture, and Smart Cities.

00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:05.075 
In spaces like smart homes, it is very beneficial that multiple assets can be connected and managed over the network.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:11.662 
Depending on the conditions at home, various activities can be performed in the house or remotely.

00:01:11.662 --> 00:01:18.146 
For example, turning on lights, changing room temperature, turning home appliances

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:24.629 
on and off, managing sound and security with a smartphone.

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:31.282 
Thus, energy and other resources consumption can be optimized.

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:34.482 
Let’s look at our smart home example closer.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:38.919 
You can have direct remote access through gateway and routers,

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:43.292 
Or interactions happen through an intermediary like a cloud application.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:48.002 
Services running in the cloud collect data from edge devices and provide the data

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:52.713 
to users of the smart home through edge devices such as phones or PCs.

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:58.048 
Multiple edge devices are connected to the gateways through local communication

00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:03.383 
protocols such as KNX, ECHONET, ZigBee, DECT ULE, and Wi-SUN.

00:02:03.383 --> 00:02:11.521 
Multiple gateways can exist in one home, whilst each gateway can support multiple local protocols.

00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:18.358 
The next one is the Industrial applications of WoT.

00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:23.308 
Let’s zoom in on this factory!

00:02:23.308 --> 00:02:32.239 
Industrial applications may resemble smart home applications, but have broad requirements. For instance, advanced monitoring of the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:41.171 
connected manufacturing equipment as well as the manufactured products and predictions of any possible machine failures.

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:49.699 
Let's look at one smart factory example in detail. This time, different factory equipment is automated based on

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:58.228 
industrial protocols such as PROFINET, Modbus, OPC UA TSN, EtherCAT, or CAN. Since industrial environments like factories, have

00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:06.756 
more strict requirements, there are multiple controllers that are connected to the manufacturing equipment. An industrial edge device

00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:15.285 
collects data from various controllers and enables remote monitoring via a dashboard or analyzes it for preventative maintenance.

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:20.035 
Another domain-specific application is in agriculture systems.

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:28.760 
With WoT, soil conditions can be monitored and optimal plans for watering and fertilizing can be created. Depending on

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:37.485 
the need, agricultural devices can be controled remotely. Thus the quality and quantity of the harvest can be increased.

00:03:37.485 --> 00:03:42.272 
The last application domain we will explain is Smart Cities.

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:51.902 
Similar to smart homes, monitoring of smart cities is possible. In this case, end users are citizens, municipalities, and government

00:03:51.902 --> 00:04:01.531 
agencies. In smart cities, bridges, dams, and canals can be monitored for material conditions or deterioration for maintenance repair work.

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:11.812 
Thus, significant damage is prevented. Parking slots and street lights can be monitored for crowd management and optimized usage too.

00:04:11.812 --> 00:04:17.718 
There are many more domain-specific examples in the WoT Architecture document besides the ones that we

00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:23.624 
listed in this video. If you want to learn more, you can check the website.

00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:28.112 
In the next video, we will explain architectural patterns in WoT.
